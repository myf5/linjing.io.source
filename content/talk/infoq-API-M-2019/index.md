summary: Talk about How does nginx help you on API-M.
abstract: "
In terms of technical form, APIs can help application services to achieve better mutual communication. On the other hand, APIs also help companies connect upstream and downstream relationships and unlock digital business models. However, with the deepening of enterprise application microservices, traditional API management solutions are complicated, how to ensure API security and life cycle management and other API deployment bottlenecks have gradually emerged.

This topic will be based on the NGINX API gateway deployment model, in-depth discussion of the micro gateway and sidecar model deployment method, and through practical case analysis, teach you how to combine F5 and NGINX Plus to achieve more secure API deployment and control."
