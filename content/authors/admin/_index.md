It has been 13+ years I focus on the industry of application delivery. Initially, I was site engineer to support big banking customers, got lots of practice during there. The experience of 4 years F5 support (TAC) let me know how to handle complicated issues, people, or technical case. I am familiar with K8s, Docker, service mesh, NGINX, Ansible, DNS, HTTP, SSL, TCP, UDP, WAF, Load balance, Identity Access Management, CDN, Web Accelerator, TCL programming. I like to dig the root of cause when I immerse in troubleshooting. 

After the TAC role, I moved to F5 APAC consulting team, I am the first one consultant in GCG.As a consultant, I delivered complicate post-sale and pre-sales projects for APAC customers. Appreciate the 4 years’ experience, I am better on time/project management and communications. 

I decided to take challenge again, so I became the first one Specialist System Engineer in GCG, This is a role that need strong hands-on, pre-sale experience, wide domains knowledge and be innovative. During the role I designed the biggest IPV4/6 smart and secure DNS architecture for the biggest bank in China, delivered the first production level F5 PaaS solution. 
3 years ago, I promoted as F5 Solution Architect, and now I am senior solution architect, focus on F5 modern App relevant solutions and business.

I have strong self-learning ability, keep passion to new technology. Also, I am blog enthusiast, keep writing blogs in the past 16 years (https://cnadn.net).

I am familiar with private cloud like openstack/SDN,Vmware. Also good on docker, k8s. I got the Open Group TOGAF v9.2 certificate and I am CNCF Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA #664), own CCNP/MCSE/JNCIS certificates. After F5 acquiring NGINX, I built NGINX Accreditation exam process and questions. I am also the first one F5 certified security solution expert in China. Beside those, I am also interested to open source technology like service mesh(Istio, envoy),observability(ELK, Prometheus, Grafana) etc.

I am the first author of the book- NGINX Classic Tutorial. I am good for talks on events or media. I am Cloud Native advocate and is a member of kube-ovn Community Steering Committee.
