abstract: ’This means that enterprises need to use new technologies and use cloud-native standards, microservices, containers, etc. to build a modern application architecture to meet the current urgent needs.' Lin Jing emphasized. In this process, F5 has been deeply involved in the application network for many years. To help enterprises build an infrastructure that can meet the needs of digital transformation and support the implementation of their cloud-native applications, it should be said that they are very familiar with it.
